# Personal_Projects
Just Stuff I've done over the years.
Majority are headfirstjava exercises.
Arduino Stuff is related to Light Data Transfer.
finalgamev3 was some old game (few bugs admittedly).
Also website work was done quite recently.
I also have a private folder for other projects, but please email me if you would like to see my other folder.
