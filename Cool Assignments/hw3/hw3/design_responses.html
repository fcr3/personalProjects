					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Definitely picked up a lot of strategies to use. The article offered
								a great perspective, in my opinion, about letting the user complete
								the picture. By that, I mean we only need to simply communicate hints.
								The user will pick up the rest.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>Probably the examples. Visual representations were especially helpful
								because they proved to me that certain things, when aligned, colored, etc., 
								the right way either seem similar or different to each other. I will
								absolutely use the information in this article to better my design.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"an organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts"</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> Solid 8. Really liked what the article had to say. The site was also
								aesthetically pleasing, so that's always a plus. Super informative
								and definitely for people who are looking to strengthen their design eye.
