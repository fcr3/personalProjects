						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There was honestly so many nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout
								this article. For instance, the rule of 8, objects closer together
								form groups, and using more white space are lessons that I took
								away from this article. I definitely will try to encorporate more
								white space from now on!
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Hands-down: the pictures. They gave their best practices in each 
								article, but what really made their argument effective was that
								readers allowed themselves to decide which was best: less white 
								or more. They also had a section addressing concerns about white
								space, and I thought that was a nice touch for the hesitant.

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
