					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Again, a medium sized article with tons of advice. Of the things I learned, I think I'll take with me the variation equations and also that graph
								with the certain hues. I actually liked the graph the most because I know the science behind it: why colors seem brighter than others. Definitely
								had a little physics/nerd-gasm there, but I was happy to see that it could be used to improve designs.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I mentioned it above: the graph of the hues. The main reason why was because of how it related to physics and the energy in light waves. Besides
								that technical stuff, I liked the writer's humor and disregard for theory and urgency for praticallity. I also identify with just getting to the point
								of things, and the writer definitely achieved that!
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>In my experience, using a “split complementary palette” is about 0% predictive of me making nice-looking designs. 
								I have another word for that sort of thing: useless.</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 7. Super helpful article again, and I definitely recommend that designers read this for a no BS take on color picking. </p>
